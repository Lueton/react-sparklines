# Roadmap

This is the roadmap for React Sparklines.

Feel free to leave feedback and ideas on Github.

:::info
While React Sparklines goals are to be as flexible as possible and provide many options it still aims to be as lightweight as possible. This means that there will be a limit for chart components. Exotic charts like funnel, pie or radar are not going to be implemented. React Sparklines is and will not be a fully chart library like Recharts, ChartJS and similar options.
